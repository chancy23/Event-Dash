# Event Dash (Group-Project-One)

#Goal and Target Users
Goal/Problem we are solving for: An easy way to create events for your friends (via social media followers or friends) and one dashboard to find events your friends from various groups (with different ways of communciating events) have created.

Target Audience: Individuals with different groups of friends who use various methods to communicate events and activities. Social people who like doing activities with groups of people.

#Functionality (at launch)
Allow users to sign in to the app with their Twitter credentials and Firebase Authentication and create events/activities for their friends (twitter followers). They can tweet out a link to the Event Dash app to share the event details.

Users can sign in with Twitter credentials and Firebase Authentication to view the events they've been invited to. At glance they see a main page with a thumbnail of each event. They can click on the Event Info button and open a screen with full detials of the event, including the location on a map.

#Future Functionality
- Have private and public events options.
- See the attendees who accepted.
- Allow users to sign in with other social media credentials or email sign in.
- Allow event creators to update and/or delete the events they created.
- Event creators can pick an image for the event thumbnail when creating event (rather than a predefined image).
- Auto delete events that have an activity date prior to the current date.
- Auto add the event to users' calendars.
- Have timer built in to event details to countdown to event.
